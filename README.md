Experiment to implement row swipe actions using
react-native-gesture-handler.

- Currently requires this patch:
https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler/pull/6 -- and
only works on alpha.2, I believe due to this change:
https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler/commit/2d330dbe94df03e8c96157298d4788e62174d361
